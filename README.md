You've landed in my digital sandbox. This is my corner of the internet where I build stuff, break it down, and try to figure out what makes it all tick. I'm driven by a need to peel back the layers of any systemâ€”be it code, language, or a creative framework.

I'm all about finding the hidden threads that connect seemingly random domains. My whole deal is mashing up hard logic with a bit of creative chaos to build something new and hopefully, something cool.
