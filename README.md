## 🤔 The Gist (Who Am I?)

You've landed in my digital sandbox. This is my corner of the internet where I build stuff, break it down, and try to figure out what makes it all tick. I'm driven by a need to peel back the layers of any system—be it code, language, or a creative framework.

I'm all about finding the hidden threads that connect seemingly random domains. My whole deal is mashing up hard logic with a bit of creative chaos to build something new and hopefully, something cool.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

This is the stuff currently taking up space in my brain and my editor:

* **🧠 Exploring Procedural Generation:** A personal project focused on learning the fundamentals of procedural generation. Currently implementing algorithms in **Python** to generate 2D tile-based maps.
* **🕸️ Web Layout Experiment:** A study on applying classical design principles (proportion, symmetry) to modern UI/UX. The goal is to create responsive web layouts using **HTML/CSS Grid and Flexbox**.
* **🛠️ "AetherScribe" CLI Tool:** A command-line tool built with **Python** that fetches data from a public weather API and uses it to structure and generate unique poetic text.

## 💻 My Tech Stack & Toolkit

The tools and tech I'm currently using to get things done.

```bash
# Languages:
$ Python | JavaScript | C++ | HTML/CSS

# Tools:
$ VS Code | Git & GitHub | Blender | Figma

# Currently Into:
$ Procedural Generation | Computational Linguistics | Generative Art | Systems Thinking | Data Visualization | Information Architecture

## 🤝 Let's Connect & Collab

I'm a huge believer that the best ideas come from bouncing them off other people. If you're into building weird stuff, exploring computational art, or think code can be a form of poetry, hit me up.

1.  **Follow** me here on GitHub if you want to see what I cook up next.
2.  **Dig through my repos**—it's a mix of serious projects and chaotic experiments.
3.  **Hit me up:**

## 📜 My "License"

Everything public here is pretty much *open-source for the mind*.

**TL;DR:** Feel free to fork it, remix it, and build something awesome with it. Just give a shout-out or let me know if it helps you create something cool. Sharing is caring, right? 😉
